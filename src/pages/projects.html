                <p>
                  This is a full featured web app I built with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>
                  in an existing CRM system for a client while working at Breankman and Company.
                  Everything on this page (except for the map and title bars) is dynamically
                  generated based on data fetched from the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app solves a <a href="https://github.com/AnadoluUniversityCeng/multiple-tsp">Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem</a>
                  in which several techs needed to be dispached to accomplish multiple jobs while optimizing for time.
                  However, this specific implementation was more complicated than the classic case because there were
                  custom limitations and requirements that had to be met. To name a few: some jobs had to be done on
                  certain days and times, each job had its own set of tasks and each tech had a list of skills that
                  specified which jobs they could do, some jobs had higher priorety ranking, the time spent on each job
                  needed to be predicted based on tasks and time metrics associated with the job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Routes are automatically generated by a complex algorithm which I designed. In adition, controls
                  were implemented to allow the user to drag and drop jobs to different days and to reorder them.
                  Data changes are tracked and relayed to the server to sync wtih the CRM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Google Maps APIs were used for the map and route planning functionality
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did not make all of the design choices for this project, but the front end and server side
                  functionality was primarily implemented by myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also built a companion mobile app which the techs used on the job sites. Check it out in the
                  <a href="#mobileDevContentToggle">Mobile Dev</a> section of this page!

                <p>
                  This is technically a cross-platform desktop app, but it's built with
                  <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, so I consider it as
                  web dev with a few extra layers of complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I developed this app while working at Brenkman and Company. This is a custom
                  route planning app designed to plan survey flights for UAVs and segment a survey
                  area into parts optimizing for drone flight time and fuel contraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I said, this app was built with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>.
                  Because Electron creates desktop apps a greater amount of vigilance is
                  needed on part of the developer to ensure that the user's computer is not compromised or
                  needlessly exposed to threats. So, I used <a href="https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template">Secure Electron Template</a>
                  as a starting point. I also followed <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md">Electron Security Best Practice</a> guidelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app also used React, Redux, and <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> (for map functionality),
                  made use of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>,
                  had file import / export functionality, and offline storage for app and map data.

                <p>
                  This is a mobile app companion that goes with the CRM web app in the Web Dev
                  section. This app pulled data from the server that was set up with the web
                  app above as well as other parts of the CRM. The app gave specific controls
                  and capabilities to the users to modify and update data for the jobs they
                  worked on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was primarily responsible for the architecting, development, testing, deployment
                  of this app. I worked directly with the client to ensure it met their needs. I also
                  worked with other developers to ensure it integrated well with the server, database,
                  and other portions of the CRM. I wrote the front and back end API logic for the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A unique challenge associated wtih this app was the need to do multiple custom
                  image processing tasks on the device. We compiled a version of OpenCV and built
                  a custom native module using Swift, Objective C, and C++ which communicated and
                  integrated with the React Native code.
